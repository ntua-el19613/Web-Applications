# Java Projects - Internet and Its Applications (NTUA)

Welcome to my Java Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of Java projects developed as part of the *Internet and Its Applications* course at the *National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)*.

## üìå Overview
These projects demonstrate various Java programming concepts, including:
- **Database connectivity** with MySQL using JDBC
- **Multithreading** for concurrent execution
- **Java Servlets** for web application development
- **JSP Pages** for dynamic web content
- **Login and Logout functionality** for secure user authentication

## üìÇ Project Highlights
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Database Connectivity with MySQL**
- Implements a `DbConnector` class to manage database operations
- Supports:
  - Establishing and closing database connections
  - User authentication
  - Storing and retrieving game data
- Technologies: *JDBC, MySQL*

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Java Multithreading**
- Demonstrates thread creation and synchronization
- Includes runnable tasks for handling concurrent operations
- Implements producer-consumer and thread pooling concepts
- Technologies: *Java Threads, Executors, Synchronization*

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Java Servlets & JSP Pages**
- Web applications using Java Servlets
- User authentication (login/logout) using session management
- Dynamic content generation using JSP
- Technologies: *Java Servlets, JSP, HTTP Sessions*

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/olgagnn/Web-Applications/edit/main/README.md
   ```
2. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE**.
3. Ensure you have MySQL running and update database credentials in `ExamDbConnector.java`.
4. Run the project from the main class or deploy to a servlet container (e.g., Apache Tomcat for web-based projects).

## üìú Requirements
- **JDK 11+**
- **Eclipse IDE**
- **Apache Tomcat (for web applications)**
- **MySQL Database**
